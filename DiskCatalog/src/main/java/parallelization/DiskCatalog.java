         * Constructor of the callable. This constructor receives all

         *
         * The search criteria on the band name, on the disk title,
         * and on the release year are provided as Optional values: An
         * empty criterion has to match any album.
         *
         * The catalog is provided as an iterator, which allows the
         * caller to use any type of Java collection. This iterator
         * points to the first album to be considered by the callable.
         * The iterators provided to the different callables must
         * correspond to a different starting point in the collection,
         * so that different callables do not consider twice the same
         * album.
         *
         * For instance, let us consider a collection with 10 albums:
         * [ A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J ]. If this collection has to
         * be processed by 3 callables, each of these callables would
         * process the following albums:
         *
         * - Callable 1: [ A, D, G, J ]
         * - Callable 2: [ B, E, H ]
         * - Callable 3: [ C, F, I ]
         *
         * Finally, the "skip" argument is necessary to avoid multiple
         * threads to consider the same album in the collection. The
         * argument indicates how many albums must be skipped between
         * each iteration over the collection. In the example above
         * with 3 callables, "skip" should be equal to 2.
